## Hosting (public facing)

If you want to host this project for your online store or similar application, **I strongly recommend using the single-player-only branch** available [here](https://github.com/pavece/guess-the-price/tree/single-player-only).

Please note: While the multiplayer functionality works fine, it's implemented with basic features only. I don't recommend using the multiplayer version as-is for public-facing deployments without additional development.

For single player hosting details, please refer to the README in the single-player-only branch.

## Hosting (for you and your friends)

Want to play with friends? Go ahead and host the full version! The multiplayer functionality is perfect for private games among friends and small groups.
